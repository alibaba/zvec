"""Header-hygiene guard for the public C++ API under ``src/include/zvec``.

The stable C++ API is ``zvec/db/*.h`` (plus ``zvec/c_api.h`` for C), and it is
the only part of ``src/include`` that installs.  The rest -- ``zvec/core/**``,
``zvec/ailego/**``, ``zvec/turbo/**`` -- is an advanced, unstable surface that
stays in the build tree: public to a source-tree consumer and to nothing else.
This script keeps the stable surface from silently absorbing engine internals,
the way ``ARROW_INSTALL_ALL_HEADERS`` does for Apache Arrow and the explicit
``install(FILES ...)`` whitelist does for LevelDB.

The stable closure is engine-free: the three headers it used to need from
``zvec/core`` and ``zvec/ailego`` now live under ``zvec/detail/``, a neutral
home both the stable API and the engine may include without inverting the layer
order.  Their old paths remain as shims so engine code keeps compiling, but the
shims are not in the closure, so no package installs ``zvec/core/**``,
``zvec/ailego/**`` or ``zvec/turbo/**`` at all.  Rule 6 fails if that regresses.

Checks
------
1. ``zvec/db/*.h`` must not include an internal header (``*_internal.h``) nor
   anything from the engine directories (``zvec/core/**``, ``zvec/ailego/**``,
   ``zvec/turbo/**``).
2. Every non-``zvec/db`` include reached from ``zvec/db/*.h`` must appear in
   ``ALLOWED_STABLE_DEPS``, so new cross-layer dependencies need a reviewed
   allowlist change.
3. Every shipped header must carry the project license header and an include
   guard (``#pragma once`` or ``#ifndef``).
4. The transitive include budget of the entry headers must stay within
   ``BUDGETS``, turning physical-design regressions into a number in CI.
5. With ``--compile-check``: every ``zvec/db/*.h`` must compile on its own with
   only ``src/include`` on the include path, i.e. it is self-contained and needs
   no internal header directory.  Skipped gracefully when no C++ compiler is
   available.
6. The stable API's transitive include closure must be fully listed in
   ``ALLOWED_STABLE_DEPS`` / ``INDIRECT_STABLE_DEPS``, and must contain no
   engine header.  That closure *is* the minimal installable SDK header set, so
   an unlisted member means a trimmed install would ship headers that do not
   compile.  The measured footprint is reported on every run.
7. ``cmake/zvec_public_headers.cmake`` -- the manifest CMake actually installs --
   must list exactly that closure, so the install rules cannot drift from the
   include graph.

Run from the repository root::

    python3 scripts/check_public_headers.py [--verbose] [--compile-check]

``--write-install-manifest`` rewrites ``cmake/zvec_public_headers.cmake`` from the
computed closure; use it after changing a public header, then review the diff.

Exit status is 0 when every check passes and 1 otherwise.
