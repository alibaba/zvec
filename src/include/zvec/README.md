# Zvec C++ / C headers

This directory is the SDK's `include/` source tree. Not everything in it carries
the same stability promise, and not everything in it is installed, so read this
before including a header or adding one.

## What actually ships

`src/include` is a build directory, not the published surface: it also holds the
engine internals. CMake installs one set out of it.

- **Installed** — the stable API and its transitive include closure,
  listed in `cmake/zvec_public_headers.cmake` (18 headers today). That manifest
  is generated, not hand-edited:

  ```bash
  python3 scripts/check_public_headers.py --write-install-manifest
  ```

  Concretely that is `zvec/db/**`, `zvec/c_api.h`, `zvec/export.h` and the three
  `zvec/detail/**` headers they reach — and nothing else. A package carries no
  `zvec/core/**`, `zvec/ailego/**` or `zvec/turbo/**` at all.

- **Never installed** — the remaining 80 headers: `zvec/core/**`,
  `zvec/ailego/**` and `zvec/turbo/**`. There is no switch that adds them, and
  no released package has ever carried them. They are still public to anyone
  building zvec from source, where they sit right here in the source tree; see
  "Advanced, unstable headers" below for what relying on them costs you.

## Libraries

A released package carries **two shared libraries**, and the headers above are
served by them:

| Library | Serves |
|---------|--------|
| `libzvec` | the whole C++ surface — `zvec/db/**` and `zvec/c_api.h`'s C++ neighbours, plus the engine API for source-tree consumers |
| `libzvec_c_api` | the C API |

`libzvec` whole-archives every component and links against a whitelist generated
from these headers (`scripts/generate_export_whitelist.py`), so it exports what a
consumer can name here and nothing else — no `zvec::sqlengine`, no `zvec::fts`,
no `*Impl`. The whitelist is generated at the *engine* surface (all 98 headers)
even though the package ships 18, so a source-tree consumer that sees the
engine headers can still link the engine API out of `libzvec`; from a prebuilt
package those extra exports are simply unreachable, because nothing there
declares them.

The standalone `libzvec_core` / `libzvec_ailego` are built but **never
packaged**: `libzvec` whole-archives both and exports the same symbols, so
shipping them too would publish two ways to call one implementation and twice
the ABI to keep compatible. If you linked `-lzvec_core` or `-lzvec_ailego`, link
`-lzvec` instead: same symbols, one library.

`libzvec.a` installs, since `zvec/db/**` does. `libzvec_core.a`,
`libzvec_ailego.a` and `libzvec_turbo.a` do not: an archive whose declaring
headers are not installed is a library that cannot be called. The mobile SDK
targets `zvec::static`, `zvec::core_static` and `zvec::ailego_static` are
build-tree only and read headers from this directory rather than from an install
tree, so they are unaffected.

## Stable public API

| Header | Use it for |
|--------|-----------|
| `zvec/db/collection.h` | Main entry point: `Collection::CreateAndOpen()` / `Collection::Open()`. Start here. |
| `zvec/db/schema.h` | `CollectionSchema`, `FieldSchema` |
| `zvec/db/index_params.h` | Per-column index configuration (`HnswIndexParams`, `IvfIndexParams`, `FtsIndexParams`, …) |
| `zvec/db/query_params.h` | Per-query tuning (`HnswQueryParams`, `IvfQueryParams`, …) |
| `zvec/db/query.h` | `SearchQuery`, `MultiQuery`, `GroupByVectorQuery`, query clauses |
| `zvec/db/doc.h` | `Doc`: the row/document value type |
| `zvec/db/doc_iterator.h` | Snapshot iteration over a collection |
| `zvec/db/reranker.h` | Hybrid-search rerank strategies |
| `zvec/db/options.h` | `CollectionOptions` and the DDL/maintenance option structs |
| `zvec/db/config.h` | `GlobalConfig`: process-wide logging and thread settings |
| `zvec/db/status.h` | `Status`, `StatusCode`, `Result<T>` |
| `zvec/db/stats.h`, `zvec/db/type.h` | Stats payload and the public enums |
| `zvec/c_api.h` | The C API. This is what every language SDK binds to. |
| `zvec/export.h` | Visibility macros (`ZVEC_API` and friends) |

### What is promised

zvec is pre-1.0, so semver's `0.x` rule applies and the surface may still change
between minor releases. What that means in practice:

- **Source compatibility within a patch series.** A patch release will not remove
  or re-signature anything in the table above. Breaking changes land in a minor
  bump and are listed in that release's notes.
- **No binary (ABI) compatibility, at any version. Rebuild when you upgrade.**
  The classes here are allocated in *your* translation unit: `Doc`,
  `HnswRabitqIndexParams` and the rest of the `*IndexParams` family have inline
  constructors, inline setters and an inline `clone()`, and are handed around as
  `std::shared_ptr`, so their `sizeof` and member offsets come from the header you
  compiled against, not from the library. A layout change therefore does not fail
  to link — an old binary loaded against a newer `libzvec` reads the wrong member
  and keeps going. Never mix one package's headers with another package's
  libraries.
- **The C API is the same story in a milder form.** The long-lived objects
  (`zvec_collection_t`, `zvec_index_params_t`, …) are opaque handles, but
  `zvec_error_details_t`, `zvec_string_t` and the array views are value structs
  whose layout is part of the interface. Call `zvec_check_version()` at startup
  to assert the minimum library your binding needs.

The intent is for these headers to become ABI-stable within a major version once
1.0 lands. Until then, treat every release as a rebuild.

## Advanced, unstable headers

`zvec/core/**`, `zvec/ailego/**` and `zvec/turbo/**` are the engine framework,
the base library and the SIMD kernels. They are **never installed** — to use
them, build zvec from source, where `examples/c++/core` and `examples/c++/ailego`
link them out of `libzvec`.

They are **internal APIs**: they may change or disappear in any
release without notice, and they are not covered by the compatibility promise
above. Being exported is not the same as being supported.

Do not include them from application code unless you deliberately want to build
against the engine itself. In particular, `zvec/db/**` must not depend on
any of them; `scripts/check_public_headers.py` enforces that.

## `zvec/detail/**` — installed, but not API

Three headers outside `zvec/db/**` are reached from the stable API itself, so
they always ship: `zvec/detail/expected.hpp` (the vendored `tl::expected` behind
`Result<T>`), `zvec/detail/float_helper.h` (`zvec::ailego::Float16`, the storage
type inside `Doc::Value`) and `zvec/detail/index_defaults.h` (the `constexpr`
knob defaults the index and query parameter constructors use).

They live under `zvec/detail/` rather than in the engine directories so that a
default package installs no engine header at all, while the engine can still
include them without depending on the db layer — `zvec/core/framework/**` needs
`tl::expected`, `zvec/core/**` and `zvec/turbo/**` both need `Float16`. Two of
them keep an engine-era spelling because that spelling is part of the ABI:
`zvec::ailego::Float16` is mangled into `Doc`'s members and
`zvec::core_interface::kDefault*` are the default arguments of the stable
constructors, so only the header paths moved.

Treat them as implementation detail that happens to be visible. Include
`zvec/db/status.h`, `zvec/db/doc.h` or `zvec/db/index_params.h` instead, and do
not rely on these paths or their contents staying put. Leaving the closure is not
planned for them: `Result<T>` and `float16_t` are part of the stable API's own
vocabulary, so the headers that define them ship for as long as those types do.

## Rules for contributors

1. **Internal helpers do not go in this directory.** Put them next to their
   implementation under `src/**` and name the file `*_internal.h`
   (e.g. `src/db/index/common/query_internal.h`). Existing examples:
   `src/db/doc_iterator_internal.h`, `src/db/collection_query_internal.h`,
   `src/db/index/common/doc_internal.h`,
   `src/db/index/common/hnsw_rabitq_params_internal.h`.
2. **A member that only the engine calls is not public API.** Either make it
   `private` and grant access through a `friend` accessor declared in an
   internal header (the `zvec::internal::DocAccess` and
   `zvec::detail::HnswRabitqRuntimeAccess` pattern), or move it out of the class
   into a free function in `zvec::internal`.
3. **Do not let engine types appear in a stable header.** Opaque members
   (`std::shared_ptr<detail::Something>` with a forward declaration) and Pimpl
   keep `zvec/core/**` and heavy third-party headers out of the transitive
   closure. See `DocIterator::Impl` and `FtsIndexParams`' `detail::FtsState`.
4. **Prefer forward declarations and `<iosfwd>`** over full includes; move
   `to_string()` / `operator==` bodies into `.cc` files when they drag in extra
   headers.
5. **Keep the include budget in check.** `scripts/check_public_headers.py`
   enforces the dependency allowlist, a transitive-include budget for the entry
   headers, and agreement between the include graph and the install manifest. It
   runs in pre-commit and in the Lint workflow:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/check_public_headers.py --verbose --compile-check
   ```

   After changing a public header, regenerate the manifest (see above) and
   tighten the budgets in the script to the new measured values — they are what
   turns "this header got heavier" into a CI failure.
6. **Adding a header to the stable closure is a decision, not a side effect.**
   Every non-`zvec/db` include reached from a stable header must be listed in
   `ALLOWED_STABLE_DEPS` or `INDIRECT_STABLE_DEPS` with a reason, because it
   then ships in every SDK package forever. Prefer an opaque member or a
   self-contained implementation in `zvec/db/**`.
