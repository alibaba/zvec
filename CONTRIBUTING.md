## Development Setup

> [!TIP]
> **Linux** is the recommended environment for development and performance benchmarking.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 - 3.14 (64-bit only)
- CMake ≥ 3.26, < 4.0 (`cmake --version`)
- A C++17-compatible compiler (e.g., `g++-11+`, `clang++`, Apple Clang on macOS)

### Clone & Initialize

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/alibaba/zvec.git
cd zvec
```

> 💡 **Tip**  
> - Forgot `--recursive`? Run:  
>   ```bash
>   git submodule update --init --recursive
>   ```
> - Set up pre-commit hooks:  
>   ```bash
>   pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install
>   ```

### Build from Source (Editable Install)
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
# This installs dev dependencies (pytest, ruff, etc.) and builds the C++ extension in-place
```

> ✅ Verify:
> ```bash
> python -c "import zvec; print('Success!')"
> ```

---

## Testing

### Run All Tests
```bash
pytest python/tests/ -v
```

### Run with Coverage (Debug/CI)
```bash
pytest python/tests/ --cov=zvec --cov-report=term-missing
```

> 🔎 See full rules in `[tool.ruff]` section of `pyproject.toml`.

## Build Customization

You can control build behavior via environment variables or `pyproject.toml`:

| Option | How to Set | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Build Type** | `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` | `Debug`, `Release`, or `Coverage` (for gcov/lcov) |
| **Generator** | `CMAKE_GENERATOR="Unix Makefiles"` | Default: `Ninja`; use Make if preferred |
| **AVX-512** | `ENABLE_SKYLAKE_AVX512=ON` | Enable AVX-512 optimizations (x86_64 only) |

Example (Debug + Make):
```bash
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug CMAKE_GENERATOR="Unix Makefiles" pip install -v .
```

## C++ Public API

Only `src/include/zvec/db/*.h` and `src/include/zvec/c_api.h` are the stable,
versioned API. `src/include/zvec/{core,ailego,turbo}/**` are the engine and may
change at any time; they are **never installed**, so a consumer that wants them
builds zvec from source. In-tree code always sees them: `src/include` is on the
compile include path.

Three headers the stable API cannot do without live in `src/include/zvec/detail/`:
the vendored `tl::expected` behind `Result<T>`, the `Float16` storage type inside
`Doc::Value`, and the `constexpr` index defaults used as default arguments. They
are installed but are **not** API. They sit outside `zvec/{core,ailego,turbo}` so
a package contains no engine directory at all, and their old engine paths
remain as shims, so engine code includes them exactly as before. The namespaces
did not move — `zvec::ailego::Float16` is mangled into `Doc`'s members — so the
relocation is ABI-neutral. `check_public_headers.py` fails if the stable closure
reaches an engine header again.

See
[`src/include/zvec/README.md`](src/include/zvec/README.md) for the boundary rules
(where internal helpers go, how to hide engine types, how to keep the include
budget in check).

A released package carries two shared libraries, `libzvec` and `libzvec_c_api`,
18 headers and `libzvec.a`. `libzvec` whole-archives every component and exports
the engine API too, so the standalone `libzvec_core` / `libzvec_ailego` — and
their archives — are built but never packaged. The invariant is that the install
tree never carries an engine artifact whose headers are absent: an installed
library that cannot be called is worse than no library. Both halves are asserted
on every staged package, in `.github/cmake/sdk-smoke/CMakeLists.txt` and in the
prebuilt workflow.

The rules are enforced by `scripts/check_public_headers.py`, which runs in
pre-commit and in the Lint workflow:

```bash
python scripts/check_public_headers.py --verbose --compile-check
```

It also owns the install manifest. After adding, removing or re-including a
public header, regenerate it and commit the diff:

```bash
python scripts/check_public_headers.py --write-install-manifest
git diff cmake/zvec_public_headers.cmake
```

A manifest diff means the SDK's header set changed, so call it out in the PR
description: every header that enters the closure ships in every package from
then on.

### Exported symbols

`libzvec` whole-archives every component plus rocksdb, arrow, antlr and
protobuf, so it links with an exported-symbol whitelist rather than exporting
everything. `src/exported_symbols_zvec.{txt,lds}` is *generated* from the
published headers -- it is the list of names a consumer can actually write --
and is what keeps engine internals such as `zvec::sqlengine` out of the ABI
surface (measured 10784 -> 2602 exports on macOS/arm64).

The pre-commit hook and the Lint workflow check it for drift. After changing a
published header, regenerate it and commit the diff:

```bash
python scripts/generate_export_whitelist.py --write
git diff src/exported_symbols_zvec.txt
```

This needs `clang++` (the header set is parsed with a clang AST dump); without
it the check skips locally and fails in CI. The list is generated at the *engine*
surface — all 98 public headers — even though the package installs 18, so
that in-tree and `add_subdirectory` consumers can still link the engine API out
of `libzvec`; `--surface stable` is the tighter alternative if that ever stops
being wanted. The standalone engine libraries (`libzvec_core`, `libzvec_ailego`)
keep the coarser namespace-wide `src/exported_symbols_cpp.*`, since their whole
`zvec::core` / `zvec::ailego` surface is their API. Both lists apply to non-Debug
configurations only, so Debug keeps full symbols for in-tree debugging and crash
symbolication. That test is a `$<CONFIG:Debug>` generator expression, not
`if(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE ...)`: a multi-config generator (Xcode, Visual Studio, Ninja
Multi-Config) has no `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` at configure time, so a plain `if()` reads
"not Debug" and whitelists the Debug configuration too. The hand-written binding
lists under `src/binding/` are unconditional — `libzvec_c_api` and the Python
module only ever export their binding surface, in every configuration.
